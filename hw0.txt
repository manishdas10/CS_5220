1. About you:

- How do you like to be called (including pronouns)?

Manish (he/him)

- What do you hope to get out of the course?

I am a ChemE PhD student working with molecular simulations and work with simulation packages already parallelized and some Fortran codes (for Monte Carlo simulations) which are single core. I would like to have the knowldege to understand and make changes in the parallelized packages and also prossibly, parallelize some aspects of our in-house fortran codes for some studies I am currently doing.

- Are there any concerns that you have at this point?

I am a bit unfamiliar with general terminologies and don't have a 
good mental picture of the computer architectures. I am working on improving that, but apart form that, the logic of the course structure sounds reasonable and really appealing to me.

2. About a peer (someone you've introduced yourself to in class):

- What is the person's name and academic area?

Nishanth Murugan, a CheME PhD student who works on computational fluid dynamics

- What is something interesting they shared?

He is a part of an intramural football team and regularly competes in local tournaments

3. About an application:

Find an application area of parallel computing that you find
interesting and say a little about it.  What are the challenges?  What
is the current state of the art in terms of high-performance codes
that address the problem?  Provide references (URLs are fine).

Parallelizing Monte carlo simulations for molecular simulations with long range intermolecular potentials
There are packages available that have parallel Monte-carlo codes for molecular simulations(https://glotzerlab.engin.umich.edu/hoomd-blue/), but they don't have the flexibility that some studies may require.
